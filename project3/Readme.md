How it Works
The app fetches quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database API.
Each question is displayed with four possible answers, and the answers are shuffled randomly.
The user selects an answer, and the app will show whether it's correct or incorrect.
After each question, the user can move to the next question.
At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed, and they can play again.
Features & Enhancements
Dark Mode: The app uses a dark background with colorful accents for a more modern look.
Randomized Answers: The answers are shuffled to avoid any patterns in their order.
Responsive Design: The app adjusts beautifully for both mobile and desktop views.
